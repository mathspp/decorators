# Initial structure

Excellent — that gives me the freedom to shape a truly effective course while grounding the content in your well-crafted blog post. I’ll make sure to clearly note any deviations from the original article and explain the pedagogical reasoning behind them.

Now that I have everything I need, I’ll begin drafting a **detailed course outline** consisting of:

* Sections (\~30–90 minutes each),
* Lessons (\~5-minute videos),
* Suggestions for where to insert “solve together” exercise videos,
* Notes about where the outline deviates from the blog post and why.

This will take a moment — I’ll draft it now.


Thanks for waiting. I’ve reviewed the full structure and I’m now ready to present a **draft course outline** based on your article, broken down into short, focused video lessons grouped into coherent sections.

I’ll include:

* Section titles (representing groups of videos),
* Individual lesson titles (each a \~5-minute video),
* Occasional “solve together” videos,
* And I’ll call out and explain any **deviations** from the blog post structure.

## 🧠 Section 1 – Why Decorators Matter (40–60 min)

**Goal**: Motivate the decorator pattern and build foundational understanding of functions and higher-order functions.

1. **Introduction – What This Course Will Teach You**
2. **The Problem: A Function That Did Too Much**
   (based on *“A function that did too much”*)
3. **Wrapping Functions Without Changing Them**
   (from *“Factoring out the orthogonal behaviour”*)
4. **Duplicated Logic: Time to Generalise**
5. **Introducing Higher-Order Functions**
   (based on *“A factory of cached functions”*)
6. **Closure Mechanics Explained**
7. **First Exercise Break (self-guided)**
8. **Solve Together: Build a Simple Cache Decorator**

**🟢 Deviation**:
I’m pulling forward the explanation of closures slightly earlier than the blog post to ensure students understand why caching works before we go further. This helps avoid confusion when they see cached functions “magically” remember values.

## 🧱 Section 2 – From Higher-Order Functions to Decorators (45–60 min)

**Goal**: Transition from function factories to Python's `@decorator` syntax.

1. **The Decorator Pattern and Its Syntax**
   (based on *“The decorator pattern”*)
2. **Applying Decorators with and without `@`**
3. **Decorator Mindset: Enhancing Orthogonal Functionality**
4. **Exercise Break: Reimplement and Apply Cache and Timed Decorators**
5. **Solve Together: Decorate Fibonacci and Benchmark It**

**🟢 Deviation**:
I’ve extracted and emphasized the mindset behind decorators (orthogonal enhancement) as its own short video — it’s implicit in your article but worth surfacing explicitly for pedagogical clarity.

## 🛠️ Section 3 – Writing General and Useful Decorators (60–75 min)

**Goal**: Make decorators robust, reusable, and practical.

1. **Why `*args` and `**kwargs` Are Essential**
   (from *“Implementing general decorators”*)
2. **Refactoring the Cache Decorator**
3. **How to Benchmark Any Function**
   (based on *“timed” decorator updates*)
4. **The Decorator Blueprint (Anatomy)**
   (based on *“Anatomy of a decorator”*)
5. **Common Pitfalls: Metadata Loss**
6. **Fixing Metadata with `functools.wraps`**
7. **Solve Together: Fix a Broken Decorator Without `wraps`**
8. **Exercise Break (self-guided)**

---

## ⚙️ Section 4 – Customising Decorators with Arguments (60–75 min)

**Goal**: Learn how and why to build decorators that accept parameters.

1. **Motivation: Customising a Cache’s Size**
2. **The Problem with `@cache(1000)`**
3. **The Solution: A Decorator Factory**
4. **Optional Arguments and Smart Decorators**
   (based on *“To parens or not to parens?”*)
5. **Exercise Break: Custom Cache with Max Size**
6. **Solve Together: Implement a Decorator with Arguments**

**🟢 Deviation**:
The article mixes “wraps” and decorator-with-arguments topics. Here, I’m grouping everything about decorators with arguments into one focused section to reinforce the concept as its own skill.

---

## 🧱 Section 5 – Class-Based Decorators (45–60 min)

**Goal**: Teach decorators as classes and when/why to use them.

1. **Functions Are Objects – So Are Classes**
2. **The Case for Class-Based Decorators**
3. **Implementing a Class-Based Cache Decorator**
   (based on *“Classes as decorators”*)
4. **Enhancing Decorated Functions with Attributes**
5. **Decorator Arguments + Classes = Clean Separation**
6. **Solve Together: `timed` as a Class-Based Decorator**
7. **Exercise Break (self-guided)**

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Section 6 – Decorating Classes (30–45 min)

**Goal**: Show decorators that target class definitions, not just functions.

1. **Yes, Classes Can Be Decorated Too**
2. **When to Use Class Decorators**
3. **Solve Together: Implement an `@add_repr` Decorator**
4. **Exercise Break (self-guided)**

---

## 🎓 Final Section – Review and Wrap-Up (20–30 min)

**Goal**: Review what was learned, offer next steps.

1. **The Decorator Toolbox: Review of Key Ideas**
2. **Quiz or Recap Exercise Suggestions**
3. **Next Steps: Fun Projects and Decorators in the Real World**
4. **Outro and Thanks**
