# Summary

Well done making it this far!
After going through this section, you should know that

 - decorators can accept arguments to allow for further customisation; and
 - to create a decorator that accepts arguments you will typically have a function that returns a decorator, which means you will have three levels of function nesting.

Now, it is time for you to learn about the ways in which decorators can be used with classes...
But first, there is one optional stop you can make.
