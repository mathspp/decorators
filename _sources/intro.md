# Decorators masterclass

This is the reference material for a decorators masterclass.

This decorators masterclass should be self-contained and, if you work through the exercises in your own time, should teach you all about decorators, from writing your very first decorator, to writing classes that can be used to decorate other classes.

If you're new to decorators, start at the beginning.

If you already have some experience, open the “Exercises” section of each chapter.
If you can solve those exercises easily, you _can_ skip that chapter.
Chapters are pretty digestible, though, so I'd still recommend you briefly review the materials to ensure you don't miss anything.

To get started, you can use the “next” arrows at the bottom of each page to automatically move to the next section.
For reference, you can also check the high-level overview of this course here:
