# Connect with me

Hey, I'm Rodrigo Girão Serrão from sunny Portugal 🇵🇹.

I'm a prolific Python author and speaker, with [multiple books published independently](https://mathspp.com/books) and [dozens of talks and tutorials](https://mathspp.com/talks) given at the largest Python conferences in the world. I also [blog frequently about Python](https://mathspp.com/blog) and publish two Python newsletters: the [mathspp insider](https://mathspp.com/insider) and the daily [Python drops 🐍💧](https://mathspp.com/drops).

I have extensive experience teaching people from all walks of life – from kids in school, to professionals in various industries, to retirees – and there is a clear consensus that my students enjoy my clear examples, the live-coding during my lessons, and most surprisingly: my quirky sense of humour.

If you'd like to connect with me, you can find me online in a number of platforms:

I'm also, and always, one email away: [rodrigo@mathspp.com](mailto:rodrigo@mathspp.com).
Sometimes, I take longer than I'd like to admit to reply to emails, but I read all of them.
