# What now?

Holy Python!
Congratulations for making it this far!

In this course you learned about a wide range of ways in which decorators can be used and defined, how to make them work with very specific types of functions, or how to write general and flexible decorators that work with all sorts of functions and that accept different arguments.

You've also seen how this concept of “decorator” can interact with classes, both by using classes to write decorators with extra functionality and by writing decorators that augment the classes that you write.
