# Your first decorator

## Objectives

In this section you will write your first decorator.
And then you will understand you actually _already_ wrote a decorator and you'll be upset because this section should be called “Your fourth decorator”, or something like that.

## Pre-requisites

For this section, it's assumed you're comfortable with manipulating functions as regular objects:

 - functions can be arguments to other functions;
 - functions can be defined inside other functions; and
 - functions can be returned from othe functions.

You should also have an intuitive understading of [what a “closure” is](../why-decorators-matter/closures-are-bubbles.md).
