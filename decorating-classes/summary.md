# Summary

Well done making it this far!
After going through this section, you should know that

 - classes can be decorated just as functions can;
 - decorators for classes usually augment the class with new methods, attributes, and more, instead of replacing the class with a new one; and
 - methods can be patched by writing a regular function and then assigning it as an attribute.
