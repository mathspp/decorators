# Feedback

Your feedback is very important to me and it shapes the content that I create for _you_, so you can learn in the best way possible.

If you have any feedback at all, be it a question, some constructive criticism, a suggestion, a comment, anything, please reach out to me.
You can either [fill in this contact form](https://mathspp.com/contact-me?subject=Descriptors%20masterclass%20feedback) or [email me at rodrigo@mathspp.com](mailto:rodrigo@mathspp.com).

If you enjoyed this course and if you learned something new, consider [leaving a written testimonial](https://mathspp.com/testimonials/write?object=course), that helps a lot.
